  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Having a brother that's been vegetarian for as long as I can remember, I was bound to find some <em>great recipes</em>. This one here is <em>no exception</em>. Want a <em>healthier</em> alternative of a tasty dessert? Then look no further.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 large or 5 medium sweet potatoes</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk of choice or coconut milk</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sweetener of choice</li>
    <li>2 tbsp your choice: almond butter, tahini, oil, buttery spread, or omit for fat-free version</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp powdered ginger</li>
    <li>Optional pinch of nutmeg</li>
    <li>2-3 cups vegan marshmallows or top with vegan marshmallow fluff</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Line a large pan with parchment.</li>
    <li>Make cuts with a knife into each sweet potato 8-10 times, going about a third of the way down with each cut.</li>
    <li>Place potatoes on the pan, and place on the oven center rack.</li>
    <li>Only now, turn the oven to 480 F. Bake 30 minutes, then turn and continue to bake (10-40 more minutes, depending on size) until you can see some of the natural sugars spreading onto the paper.</li>
    <li>Measure a packed 3 1/2 cups of the sweet potato (skin removed) into a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Mash with remaining ingredients except marshmallows.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
    <li>Grease an 8Ã—8 pan, and spread the potato filling into the pan.</li>
    <li>Top with marshmallows. (If using fluff, add it after baking instead.)</li>
    <li>Bake 20 minutes, or until filling is hot and marshmallows have browned. Serve hot. Leftovers can be covered and refrigerated 3-4 days.</li>
  </ol>
